# Movies-ETL

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to extract movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle to transform and clean the data by using python, and finally loading it into a readable file to be used in PostgreSQL. This will help The Amazing Prime video team to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain.
